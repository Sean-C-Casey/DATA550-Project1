## Group Work

- How did the team work together as a whole overall ?
- We collaborated well on this project. We met up once to talk about our dataset. We discussed the meaning of the variables and our interpretation of them. We then both worked on making visualizations on our own time. We met up a second time to discuss each other's visualizations and help improve them. Throughout the week we also shared and discussed ideas via Slack.
